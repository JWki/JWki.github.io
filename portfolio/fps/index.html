         <h1>First Person Shooter Techdemo</h1>
         <p>Another attempt at making something with actual gameplay&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/fps/thumbnail.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>I think the very first game I ever wanted to make was a Doom 3 clone. Not that I would have been able to play Doom 3 at that time, since I was about 13 years old and I think it hadn&rsquo;t come out yet either, but I had read a preview in a popular German PC gaming magazine and somehow that preview launched me into the world of game development.
Ever since then, first person shooters are what I considered to be one of the royal genres of video gaming that always stood at the frontier of technological development.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/fps/lights.png" alt="cook torrance" />
<em>Cook-Torrance makes everything prettier!</em> </p>

<p>Naturally, most of my many attempts at making my own game ended up being first person shooters. Now, after a few years of actually knowing how games work under the hood and especially how my former dream game, Doom 3, works internally - after all, the source code is available to everyone now - I thought I&rsquo;d relaunch my attempts at making a first person shooter. I haven&rsquo;t actually gotten to a point yet where anything is playable of course, since I needed to put this on halt again, but I very much want to pick this project up again at some point in the future.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/fps/textures.png" alt="textures" />
<em>Every FPS game needs a plcaeholder texture.</em> </p>

<p>While I was actively working on it, I focused on not spending a lot of time on generic engine code but instead directly go for more exciting features such as the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>First person movement and collision detection using PhysX.</li>
<li>Hierarchical view system to allow for view-models like guns to be rendered at a different field of view and detail levels.</li>
<li>DX11 powered forward renderer with support for physically based material rendering (duh), set up for (yet to be implemented) clustered light culling.</li>
<li>Mesh based decal system (which turned out to probably be too slow) which supports application of decals on any surface including skinned meshes.</li>
<li>Flat inheritance based object model with a simple property reflection system supporting generic scene (de-)serialization.</li>
<li>Basic level editing tool making use of the aforementioned object model.</li>
</ul>

<p>As should be apparent from this list, my main focus when starting this project was to really fast get to a point where I could make levels and have a player run around in them as well as enabling them to interact with the environment in some way (in this case through splatting decals all over the place).</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/fps/decalsWIP.png" alt="decal debug" />

<em>Proper debugging visualization support is essential to developing visual features such as decals.</em></p>

<p>If I get a chance to pick this project up again, I will probably overwork the object model to be more data driven rather than code driven, replace the mesh based decals (which were a <em>lot</em> of work but only delivered very subpar performance on spawning due to the complexity of the mesh generation algorithm) with two distinct solutions - namely some sort of &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; decals for static geometry and a more advanced, texture space painting solution for characters - and re-implement the renderer on top of DX12 instead of DX11 in order to get access to bindless texturing (and generally because I prefer the API by now).
I would also probably try to recover and integrate <a href="../level_editor">my old brush-based level editor</a>, since it&rsquo;s a perfect fit for the kind of game I have in mind.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/fps/editor.png" alt="ui" />
<em>Bare-bones level editor UI</em> </p>

<p>As its current state is relatively broken and half-baked, I have not made this project available on github.</p>
